# Macro-Grow-A-Garden-I-Guess
nah, couldn't wait for the next Macro, Screw it, add in the settings myself inside

any ways this is just for recent updates, very simple to change though, but buying out eggs ain't that great, so it just go through all eggs

any ways you still do need Auto Hotkey, same one used in Virage Macro, this IS Virage Macro but i just tweaked it myself
